cube + rotor
------------

#### Rotor for antennas (or whatever needs to be moved in space)

###### keypoints:

* alt-az (easy to convert to equatorial, by adding a base)
* T-slot aluminum frame
* Worm drive + steppers (direct or belt drive)
* each axle: 2x ball bearings for worm gear, 2x ball bearings for axle/mast
* Horizontal axle (and its needed holes on the cover) is lower than the electronics (waterproofing)
* optional: mount for extra vertical antenna mast
